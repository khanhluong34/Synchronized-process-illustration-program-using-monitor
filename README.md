1. The case that we will use monitor for process synchronization: 
model.StockMonitor Trading System: In a stockMonitor trading system, multiple clients can try to buy or sell stocks simultaneously. To avoid race conditions and data inconsistencies in the stockMonitor information, we can use monitors to synchronize the access to the stockMonitor information.
2. Steps to build a program:
    - Create a model.StockMonitor class that represents a stockMonitor in the stockMonitor trading system. This class will be used as a monitor to synchronize access to the stockMonitor information.
    - Create multiple threads to represent clients who want to buy or sell stocks. Each thread will call the buy or sell method of the model.StockMonitor class, which will be synchronized using the monitor.
    - Create a main method that creates multiple instances of the model.BuyerThread and model.SellerThread and starts them.
